This can be used after loading the Iris dataset as follows:

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

Data = load_iris()
X = Data['data']
Y = Data['target']

Then apply the selection

X_50 = X[Idxs_50, :]
Y_50 = Y[Idxs_50]

X_60 = X[Idxs_60, :]
Y_60 = Y[Idxs_60]

X_70 = X[Idxs_70, :]
Y_70 = Y[Idxs_70]

X_80 = X[Idxs_80, :]
Y_80 = Y[Idxs_80]

X_90 = X[Idxs_90, :]
Y_90 = Y[Idxs_90]

X_100 = X[Idxs_100, :]
Y_100 = Y[Idxs_100]
